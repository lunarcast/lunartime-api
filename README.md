# Lunartime API

## Lunartime is a small button game, in which users try to press the button after the longest time

This repository is for the `TypeScript` API that uses `ws`. There is also [a repository for the client](https://github.com/lunarcast/lunartime) which is written in `PureScript` and uses `concur`.

TODO:
- [ ] Write docs on how to use the API
- [ ] Set up CI
- [ ] Add request validation
